# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This project utilizes object oriented programming in order to dynamically generate a team's profile with details about its members on a webpage. Through node.js, a user can invoke the application through their terminal and after some inquirer prompts, the application will create an index.html that matches the user input.

Below is a walkthrough video that will show anybody who wants to use this application how to go about doing so. It will also detail some of the features involved in this project, including validation for prompts.
